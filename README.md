React Hook designed to extend the **useState** hook using **localStorage** as the persistance method on the browser, ready for **TypeScript** environments too.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add use-remember-state
```

or

```bash
npm install --save use-remember-state
```

## Why

When you use **useState** you need to give a _default value_, usually it's just used as a placeholder, but what if you want that value to be data you already put before?, the common solution is to use the _default value_ calling **localStorage.getItem(_name_)**, but of course you need to call **localStorage.setItem(_name_, _value_)** before, and this call should be handled everytime the value you want to save is changed. And you have to keep in mind that if you have **SSR** implemented, there is no **localStorage** on the server, so you need fallbacks, so clearly it just becomes a nightmare and tons of repetitive code.

All that problem is solved using the custom hook **useRememberState**

## Usage

The return values from the hook are exactly the same as **useState**, but the arguments should be first a **consistent name** which is going to be used as **key** for **localStorage**, and after that a **default value**, which is going to be used as fallback for the first time render or server side rendering.

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from "react";
import { useRememberState } from "use-remember-state";

const HelloWorld: FunctionComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useRememberState("HelloWorldInput", "");

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This input remembers the input after every reload</p>
      <input
        value={data}
        onChange={({ target: { value } }) => {
          setData(value);
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Keep in mind that the name should be **unique** around the app.

For server side rendering the default value is only going to be used for the first render, but after the component is mounted on the browser, it will try to fetch again to **localStorage** looking for the data.

### SSR

Handling SSR correctly and efficiently with `localStorage` has it's problems, so in order to prevent setting state twice (therefore, rendering an extra time) and at the same time preventing the warning "**_useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server_**" when using SSR you **have to** specify an optional third argument:

```js
useRememberState(name, defaultValue, { SSR: true });
```

### Debounce

Accessing `localStorage` is computationally expensive, in order to improve performance all the calls to `localStorage` are [**debounced**](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/#debounce), the default amount of delay is `500` _ms_, you can change it to any amount, or set it to `0` to make the calls synchronously.

```js
useRememberState(name, defaultValue, { debounceWait: 100 });
```
